# Important
- This example is a simple example to show how to use the depthai library in Android and still it is in progress, so expect bugs. For a proper support of the library in Android, you will have to wait a bit more for the official release.
- Known issue: it is necessary to allow the app to acces the MyriadX (multiple times) every time the app launches. If you have any solutions, please submit a PR.

# Compiled App (.apk)
If you want to download the app directly without having to compile the project. You can download it in the Release tab.

# Dynamic Library
The [arm64 dynamic library](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/depthai-android-jni-example/blob/main/app/src/main/libs/depthai/arm64-v8a/libdepthai-core.so) (depthai-core) was compiled in Ubuntu 20.04 using the *xlink_device_search_improvements* branch. If you are interested in compiling it yourself, please ask in the Discord channel referenced below.

# License
I have copied directly some of the include folders for some of the dependency libraries. Therefore, all the code except the ones inside the include folder are free to use. I will try to fix it adding submodules in the future.
